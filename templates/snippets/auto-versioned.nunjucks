<p>By default, a web site or web app is always up to date. You’re able to choose how often you roll out updates and to whom you roll out new features. Updates happen transparently to the user without requiring explicit approvals. This makes A/B testing of new versions trivial. But most importantly it makes getting 100% of your users upgraded to the latest and hottest an actual reality.</p>

<p>In contrast, native apps are bound to update delays and reviews that often take up to two weeks, depending on the vendor. When the update arrives, installation often requires the explicit agreement of the user.</p>

<p>It’s no coincidence that many news sites embrace the mobile web. If your app demands to be fresh at all times for all of your users, choose the web.</p>

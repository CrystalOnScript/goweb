Native apps in comparison need to be installed, a conscious process that involves friction (click throughs, heavy download sizes, passwords), and often constant risk assessment from the user.</p>

<p>The point of entry for web sites and apps is entirely effortless. This is important for more than security reasons. What if your app is only needed twice a year? Even if you get somebody to install these types of apps, the stickiness of the home screen isn’t any help.

If your app is used less often, it’ll be forgotten quickly after it’s installed. Instead, what if your app were only a Google search away, instantly available when users need it, and gone when they don’t?</p>

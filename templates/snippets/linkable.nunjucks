<p>Why are social games so much more popular than native games? There’s a powerful messaging concept built into the web: Hyperlinks! Link sharing and multiple entry points open social games to the possibility of going viral.</p>

<p>Sure, you could share achievements out to Facebook or Twitter from an Xbox game, but there’s a gap. How does the person who sees your share get into the game? If it was built on the open web, all she would literally have to do is click on the provided link. What if shareable interactions are part of the game itself? For example, within a trivia app you could forward individual questions as links to your followers on Twitter. Your followers could answer the questions and get hooked on the game without installing anything. We can likely agree that this has more impact than a link to a native app or a link to an ad for console game.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this applies to more than just games. Almost all web apps and sites profit from links that interconnect them and make the web flow.</p>

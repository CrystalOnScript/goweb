<p>Corporate controlled App Stores, for all their advantages, come with strings attached. Their offerings are controlled and shaped to match the culture of the platform organization, thus excluding or severely restricting whole categories of apps that are perfectly legal but not wanted. Other restrictions can apply when your app competes with a OS provided app or when your app wants to use a different payment provider. The App Storeâ€™s approval process is often a black box and there is little room for discussion or dealing with ambiguously rejected apps.</p>

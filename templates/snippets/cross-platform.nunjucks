<p>Do you want your app to be everywhere? The web is everywhere. No, really. It’s available in almost every country of the world. It’s on TVs, PCs, laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, refrigerators and toasters. OK, maybe not toasters, but you get the point.</p>

While there are always browser differences, device differences, and UI considerations, the same set of developers can handle the workload for all of them, making the entire development cycle much less expensive. Hiring individual talent for each platform is much more risky and difficult, and porting apps to multiple programming languages is a lengthy maintenance nightmare.</p>

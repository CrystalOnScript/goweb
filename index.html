                    <p>There are currently intense philosophical debates between developers who embrace native application development and those who build on the open web about why their platform is best. But it’s not an either/or. The web platform offers unique capabilities and advantages over native, depending on the context of your site and app.</p>

                    <p>Explore when you should choose the web over native and when not, and walk through some unique user-facing abilities and features the open web provides.</p>

                    <p>Do you want your app to be everywhere? The web is everywhere. No, really. It’s available in almost every country of the world. It’s on TVs, PCs, laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, refrigerators and toasters. OK, maybe not toasters, but you get the point.</p>

                    <p>Building for the web means building across operating systems and devices. While there are always browser differences, device differences, and UI considerations, the same set of developers can handle the workload for all of them, making the entire development cycle much less expensive. Hiring individual talent for each platform is much more risky and difficult, and porting apps to multiple programming languages is a lengthy maintenance nightmare.</p>

                    <p>While native apps currently provide more discoverability than the web through custom app stores, the web has an unbeatable ability to be found, especially if your site is content heavy. Provided that your site is freely accessible, search engines index all of the content within your app or site and make it available for their users. The more content and sub pages, the more doors open for your visitors. A native app usually only has a single point of entry*.</p>

                    <p>By default, a web site or web app is always up to date. You’re able to choose how often you roll out updates and to whom you roll out new features. Updates happen transparently to the user without requiring explicit approvals. This makes A/B testing of new versions trivial. But most importantly it makes getting 100% of your users upgraded to the latest and hottest an actual reality.</p>

                    <p>In contrast, native apps are bound to update delays and reviews that often take up to two weeks, depending on the vendor. When the update arrives, installation often requires the explicit agreement of the user.</p>

                    <p>It’s no coincidence that many news sites embrace the mobile web. If your app demands to be fresh at all times for all of your users, choose the web.</p>

                    <p>While it is difficult to build native apps that stream and lazy-load content and logic when needed, web apps and sites are naturally able to amend their logic and content after the initial page load. Only the web platform gives you the ability to create the impression of an instant load.</p>

                    <p>As web apps don’t have to be distributed in a single container, it’s perfectly valid to preload the first visible content and make it available to the user in less than a second, then lazy-load the rest of it without the user's awareness. While performance during runtime is a different topic, the web cannot be beaten if your goal is the immediate availability of your app.</p>

                    <p>Corporate controlled App Stores, for all their advantages, come with strings attached. Their offerings are controlled and shaped to match the culture of the platform organization, thus excluding or severely restricting whole categories of apps that are perfectly legal but not wanted. Other restrictions can apply when your app competes with a OS provided app or when your app wants to use a different payment provider. The App Store’s approval process is often a black box and there is little room for discussion or dealing with ambiguously rejected apps.</p>

                    <p>To be truly independent and free of fear of censorship, you have to embrace the open web. If you are building an adult entertainment or file sharing app, or prefer PayPal as payment method, go web.</p>

                    <p>Web apps and sites open with a single click, and with the implicit guarantee to the visitor that nothing terribly bad will happen. Native apps in comparison need to be installed, a conscious process that involves friction (click throughs, heavy download sizes, passwords), and often constant risk assessment from the user.</p>

                    <p>The point of entry for web sites and apps is entirely effortless. This is important for more than security reasons. What if your app is only needed twice a year? Even if you get somebody to install these types of apps, the stickiness of the home screen isn’t any help. Studies show that there’s a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/an-upper-limit-for-apps-new-data-suggests-consumers-only-use-around-two-dozen-apps-per-month/">clear upper limit for individual app usage per month</a>. If your app is used less often, it’ll be forgotten quickly after it’s installed. Instead, what if your app were only a Google search away, instantly available when users need it, and gone when they don’t?</p>

                    <p>Finally, installation-free also means risk-free tryouts. Few native app stores offer the ability to give what the web offers by default: the ability to try an app before buying it.</p>

                    <p>Why are social games so much more popular than native games? There’s a powerful messaging concept built into the web: Hyperlinks! Link sharing and multiple entry points open social games to the possibility of going viral.</p>

                    <p>Sure, you could share achievements out to Facebook or Twitter from an Xbox game, but there’s a gap. How does the person who sees your share get into the game? If it was built on the open web, all she would literally have to do is click on the provided link. What if shareable interactions are part of the game itself? For example, within a trivia app you could forward individual questions as links to your followers on Twitter. Your followers could answer the questions and get hooked on the game without installing anything. We can likely agree that this has more impact than a link to a native app or a link to an ad for console game.</p>

                    <p>Of course, all of this applies to more than just games. Almost all web apps and sites profit from links that interconnect them and make the web flow.</p>

                    <p>Native platform providers boast about the new features they add every year when compared to the web. They conveniently fail to mention that it’s a lack of standardization that allows them to do this. Corporate platforms come and go and rarely last longer than a decade.</p>

                    <p>The web is built for the long haul. Through the standardization of the W3C, the brightest minds in the world are making sure that the platform you built on is rock solid, consistent, and well supported. This means that the foundation of knowledge, code, and talent you build today will remain relevant in the future.</p>

                    <p>More importantly, it means that your users will probably be able to use your site 20 years from now, even if you abandon its active development. The same cannot be claimed for native platforms.</p>
